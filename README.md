# EZRage.com

This project was originally started for [@MartinDenn](https://twitter.com/MartinDenn) & [@EZRagecom](https://twitter.com/EZRagecom). An agreement was made for us to complete the project within 2-4 weeks. The majority of work you see here was done in a two week window betweemn 10-20-2019 and 11-3-2019. _(This statement is validated based on the repository commit history and live streaming VOD's.)_ Upon delivery of the [MVP DEMO](https://ezrage.chips.gg), the client refused to provide the requested & required feedback neeeded to continue working on the project confidently. [@MartinDenn](https://twitter.com/MartinDenn) decided he wanted to hire another dev to complete the task without informing me of his decision. So, we have choosen to give this code out for free.
